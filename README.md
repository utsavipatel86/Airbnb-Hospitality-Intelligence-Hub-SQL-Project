# Airbnb-Hospitality-Intelligence-Hub-SQL-Project

The 'Hospitality Intelligence Hub' uses MySQL to analyze data which
contains information on various neighborhoods in New York City,
including the types of listings available, the prices of these listings, and
their availability. The system tracks trends in customer behavior and
preferences, such as frequently booked room types, price trends for
specific neighborhoods etc.

In our case study on Airbnb's Hospitality Intelligence Hub, we have two
tables: 'Listings' and ‘Booking_Details. The ‘Listings' table contains
information on the various neighborhoods in New York City, including
the types of listings available in each neighborhood. The 'Reviews'
table, on the other hand, has information on the prices of these
listings, reviews and their availability
